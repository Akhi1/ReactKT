Topics discussed in today's session

about api service calls using both Fetch API offered by javascript and also Axios library

noticed how different responses were in both the methods where one responded with a promise and axios with a larger dataset

discussed on how to use conditional rendering (using ternary operator and &&)

iterated a bunch of data (an entire card component) using the map() operator repeatedly

created a custom client for axios function call that used create() to make the connection

all the operations were created with a working post and get api service for login and generated token was used to check and route to certain page (or error page instead)
